CISA made sector risk agency and is now a lead that works with local officials to secure elections.  This is working to improve security and resiilience of infrastructure,  those admin, securing elections.  As a result of this, election officials ran secure elections and no evidence of threat actors having material impact on elections.  See states run elections.  



How things have been going so far.  Any significant outside attempts?
- Context of general election in UK was important.  In march the govenment called out attempts and success on those administering the election process
	- Looked into both local and general elections
	- Found it had impacted recently.  
	- Not just chinese but those everywhere.
	- They saw attempts to disrupt, but it was clearly a smooth process
		- people still voted securely.
- In EU found prep is key because the rightto vote and do it secretly is very important. 
	- If you look at both dutch and rest of EU..  Found DDOS during the voting process.
	- Found some attempts prior, but were minor and on local or national levels.  Wasn't a big impacted
		- Low impact because were prepared. 
	- Had an exercise last year to ensure folks know the process.  Practice what you preach and how these things are done. 
	- The threat is MCUH bigger now


How is the threat evolving ??
- Fact the cyber and infrastructure community is tightly connected, is good, helps everyone to learn from each other, and exchange people to help combat threat actors.
- Threat actors are entrepreneurs and won't always use the same actics.
- Election infrastructure never more secure, but they aren't complacent.
- Threat env has never been so complex, Everyone is trying to influence thing, even intelligence and information manipulation and deep faking things.
- Efforts by China, Russia, Iran to influence elections is a threat, with Russia lading
	- Russia is using PR firms, marketing firms, and americans to hide behind to get out influence messaging. So america 2works with state and local officials to reduce all of the risk across the board.
	- Works with FBI, intel community colleagues, etc.  Use the Rumor vs. Reality website to provie info on election security.
	- Trying to amplify voices of the officials,  So if curious talk to state and local because they are the ones leading it.

What's happening outside EU, USA, and Britain?
- Cyber is a team sport, not defined by anyone in particular,.  We do that via joint advisories, calling out APTs, etc.  Defending our democracy is shared across the world ,  and everyone shares things and lessons learned.
- One of the key things is the lexicon about imnformation operations, information language needs to evolve,  and we go to things like deepfakes prior to understanding them.  
- Officials go to the evidence base prior to understanding it like deep fakes.

Election Systems,  While each place, each county, each everything does things differently, but many processes are the same.  So websites report results etc.
- What steps have been taken to harden voting related systems in these territories? Can they withstand a cyber attack?
- The reason XML can be used for voting and electronic systems,  the most voting is done via paper, and it is a split, so it's auditable.  The votedr,  he or shee needs to see their vote on the ballot.  So in Europe, either do one or the other.  In europe you have a lot of different parties.  So if you vote for one on page 35, you need to make sure yours is counted.  So the auditable trails are very important.  In Europe because it's a national responsibility and security environment it is a responsibility for the member states.
- What the EU does is try to combine all the knowledge, do crisis management exercises.  During and before elections there is a lot of information sharing.  X,Y,Z has happened in Z,Q,R places. So sharing of information makes sure everyone everywhere has the full picture.
- On US infrastructure, states run elections.  If you've seen one state's election you  have only seen that one singular infrastructure.  That is how unique they are.  They are very heterogenous.  This helps lend to its resiliency.  So vote everything,  Casting and tabulation are not connected to the internet.  But at the end of the day election officials utilize defense in depth like everyone else.
	- Procedureal, and technical controls.
- USA works with offficials on the full range.  So they've even done over a thousand physical,cyber,training, evaluations and tabletops etc. To reduce risk across all spectrums.  From the threat of foreign influence and disinformation.  The american people want and need confidence in Cyber processes.  So we have still pencil and paper in the UK.  So to some extent, that does provide us with digital leniency.
- In UK, they engage with election officials everywhere.  The national security counterparts have done the same, for how we bring the best of our knowledge to support them. They work together all of these industries together to do things.   And adversaries are doing their best to infiltrate anywhere they can.

What does it mean to have a secure election?
- Elections are complicated, we have millions of election workers, thousands of polls, we'll have 150 million american votoing on the day of, or leading up to it.  And so because of the complexity things will go wrong, a poll worker will forget a key, someone will unplug a printer,  there'll be a storm, a DDOS,  a ransomware attack..  Good news is Election officials are crisis management people.  They know how to deal with these types of disrutions, so they knjow how to do it.  They may be disruptive, but the integrity and CIA of votes is kept.  The adversaries will very much try to mislead into believing otherwise.
- We shoulld expect adversaries from stoking discord, from underminging the integrity of voting processes. 
- It is up to all of us to preserve democracy.  
- If anyone has an issue with the integrity then go and do it.  They will talk you through all of the protections in place.  It is on all of us to preserve democracy.

Crowdstrike?? Single vendor points of failure??
- Early voting locations?
- How is everyone working to ensure nothing happens again like this.
	- Resiliency is the buzz word and the important thing.  Our orgs, big or small are important.  Cyber needs to be as important as alll of your accounts, protecting everytiing for the organization.  All orgs in the room need to be a part of the convo and do the best they can.
	- For the UK knowing your critical assets, knowing and identifying risks both accidental unknown and otherwise.
		- IT is the basics of emergency planning, polanning for the worst and hoping for the best.  Making it as easy as possible for oboardrooms, trustees etc, so important. 
	- For EU
		- It is a professional mechanism, it's very organized, if you wanna know how it's going then be a poll worker.  It is a multi purpose where each checks the other so it's not simple,  vote cast and count is all done in the same location.  Those processes are safe and secure,  technical means of communicating fforward is a double process, bothe electronically and a paper trail.  If it seems not ok the whole process starts again.  There is full trust with every working top to bottom. 
	- For USA
		- For crowdstrrike, when they saw it they were early on assessing impact, working with CS to get mitigation guidance out, and figure out how to reduce risk to american people on interruption of services.
		- Takeaways
			- They aren't in the blame game business
				- As a communicty we were well connected, we had a turnkey process to reach out to infrastructure and everyone, assess, and get guidance.
				- Second, it just reingforced what we were saying about tech vendors, deploying software that is secure by design. Which shows cyber folks are not immune to software quality issues.
				- Big lesson is the resilience,  So this is exactly what china wants to do but without rolling back an update.
					- What we know about cyber hackers like volt typhoon is they are embedding in critical infrastructure for the purpose of disruption in the event of a major conflict,  so a war on asia will have pipeline explosions, comms problems, etc. To insight panic and deter will of the nation.  So the lesson is what we need to do to build the resilience now so we're prepared for the mass disruption.  What we can do to drive down these risks is imperative.  On Critical infrastructure and volt typhoon no evidence of access so far, but they're positively ID'd when found, and are worked with anyone to evict them when it comes to critical infrastructure.  So much we don't know and they're sophisticated,  So we have to assume they can do things, and prep now. 
					- We have to be more prepared for supply chain attacks, and these multifaceted corporation attacks are the biggest targets and issues for the next years
					- CSIRT network in Europe, UK, and EU were talking together to understand the impact, the infrastructure, and find what is going on, do we need to worry, how are we going to approach everything.  This was good and interesting exercise.  
Misinformation and disinformation.
- Fact checking is not as effective as everyone hoped, it takes more work to refute bad info than to create it.  So how do you decide whether to decide on how to weigh in on mis or disinformation.  So that's an important question.  So NTSC specifically has information in cyber. 
- LEading to our election, we saw a lot of AI generated content,  more of it was funny rather than to insight fear or interfere dramatically.  That's an example of why we need to understand what it is we're worried about, and our roles in cyber threats.  What is the connectivity between all of these sectors?
	- It is our responsibility across the board to be responsible in the language that we're using.  Discipline in govenment etc.  Tabletopped how it works, how these things play out.  But that is all you know when that's happening.  What is important,  what is the important, need to understand things prior to taking an action.
- There are 9 things in europe that go to understand what's happening.  They focus on this disinformation and try to make sure it isn't overgrown, they look at local and outside things,  there is a digital services act which tells folks not to give out advice on elections.  They hope it will work.
- In the USA, the entity that UK has didn't get off the ground, they don't make judgements on content, they are focused on tactics foreign folks use to try to influence the public,  PR marketinfg firms, unwitting folks, they put out savvy consumer tactics, critical thinking, and general knowledge information for security. If go to national association for state have trusted stuff 2024, almost every state has their own website so people can learn the aspects of infrastructure security at that level.  At EOD most important hing to do is to ensure that people are getting their information from the authoritattive subjectmatter experts. So when you want the real deal go to election officials, which is where we should be sending people. IF it veers away it's noise.  

Deepfakes and genai targeting candidates in moldova, and elsewhere.  Wanted to ask about moldova in pparticular, seen a lot of things happening, infrastructure, mis and disinformation, what lessons are we seeing happening there with history and proximity, is it a testing ground???

- In moldova, they did an article on this, kate connoly who is senior advisor, they've seen examples trying to use gen AI to have an election impact.  AI will exacerbate current threats, but won't create new threats for th election cycle.  They've dealt with it in the AI primary.  There was a robo call telling people not to vote.  Attorney general called it out as an attempt to suppress the vote.  And using comms channels to acknowledge it as a crime, and one that is being investigated.  It comes down to communications, ability to respond, and voters having faith in state/local officials who want to ensure the confidence of all of this.
